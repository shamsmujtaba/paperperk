                        <div class="p-faq">
                            <p>A balanced chemical equation refers to an equation where the number of molecules on the left side of the equation is equal to the number of molecules on the right side. In a balanced chemical equation, the molecular mass and net charge of the reactants are exactly equal to the molecular mass and net charge of the products. It follows the law of conservation of mass which states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. It can only be transferred from one form to another.</p>

                        <div class="p-faq">

                          <p>Chemical equations must always be balanced to follow the law of the indestructibility of matter. According to this law, the total mass of the products during any physical or chemical change must be equal to the total mass of the reactants because matter can neither be destroyed nor created. If a chemical reaction is unbalanced, it means it is defying the law of conservation of mass which cannot happen in the natural world.</p>

                                    <p>Does the mere thought of writing chemistry assignments give you anxiety? You are not alone. Chemistry is a challenging subject as it studies matter at the atomic and molecular level and involves a lot of math.</p>
                            <p>Organic chemistry especally is one step ahead in posing challenges with so many exceptions defying the general trends and pattern. That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://paperperk.com/our-writers">our writers</a> come to the rescue and help you get your assignment done on time.</p>
                           <h2><div class="blue-header">How to Get the Most out of Our All-Round Chemical Equation Checker!</div></h2>
                            <p>Our multifaceted chemical equation balancer acts as a lifesaver when you are all lost for tips and tricks to balance a complicated chemical equation. Though it solves complicated chemistry problems, it is very simple to use. Here's how to use it like a pro.</p>
                            <h3>Find our free chemical equation checker</h3>
                            <p>You cannot use a thing unless you can find and access it. We offer 24/7 access to everyone, from anywhere. Visit our website, click on free tools in the navigation bar and there you go: you have found our free balanced equation checker.</p>
                            <h3>Take a minute and familiarize yourself with it</h3>
                            <p>Explore the way our tool works and try to find what input it requires to generate the desired output. As user-friendly as our chemistry calculator's interface is, it should not take you more than a few minutes to move to the next step.</p>
                            <h3>Give what it takes</h3>
                            <p>Even an accidental look at the tool's interface will give you a fair idea about what it takes to generate the result. It gives you the choice to either input only the reactants or write the complete unbalanced equation to get a balanced one.</p>
                            <h3>Get it to process the input</h3>
                            <p>Once you have entered the details it requires, click on the "Balance" button to get the process of balancing underway. It won't take more than half a quarter of a minute to come up with a balanced chemical equation.</p>
                            <h3>Cast a brief glance at the output</h3>
                            <p>We don't suppose you would just mindlessly copy and paste the generated balanced equation. If you intend to do so, we advise you to take your time and review it to make sure it is completely balanced. Make sure the number of molecules on the left side of the equation is equal to the number on the left side.</p>
                            <h3>Learn as you go</h3>
                            <p>Our online chemical equation checker is programmed under the instruction of our writers to provide a step-by-step guide to let you learn how it balances your equation. Do have a look at it before leaving the site.</p>
