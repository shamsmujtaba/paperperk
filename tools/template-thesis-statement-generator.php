<p>You may be using a template and don't realize it contains content that isn't yours. Or maybe you're researching, and some of the information you find online is the same as what you have in your paper.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, we've covered you with our free plagiarism checker! With this tool, we'll scan your work, tell you if any part of it has been copied from another source, and even show you where the overlap is so that you can make changes as needed.</p>
<p>Our plagiarism-checking tool is 100% free, and it'll show you exactly where the similarities between your work and others are so you can make changes.</p>
<p>It's simple: paste your text and click "Submit." Then, watch as our software analyzes your work and finds all the places where it's similar to other content on the web.</p>

It's a quick way to ensure that people know exactly where their ideas came from and give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>Plagiarism isn't just wrong; it's also deplorable. It's not much fun getting a paper back that says, "You copied and pasted this right off the Internet!" Fortunately, there are Paper Perk's tools.
